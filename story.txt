@@@ GUIDE ON HOW TO READ THE BOOK

=== START ===

You've hiked through Snake Canyon once before while visiting your Uncle Howard at RedCreek Ranch, but you never noticed any caveentrance. It looks as though a recent rock slide hasuncovered it. Though the late afternoon sun is striking theopening of the cave, the interior remains in totaldarkness. You step inside a few feet, trying to getan idea of how big it is. As your eyes become usedto the dark, you see what looks like a tunnel ahead,dimly lit by some kind of phosphorescent materialon its walls. The tunnel walls are smooth, as if they
were shaped by running water. After twenty feet orso, the tunnel curves. You wonder where it leads.You venture in a bit further, but you feel nervousbeing alone in such a strange place. You turn andhurry out. A thunderstorm may be coming, judging byhow dark it looks outside. Suddenly you realize thesun has long since set, and the landscape is lit onlyby the pale light of the full moon. You must havefallen asleep and woken up hours later. But thenyou remember something even more strange. Justlast evening, the moon was only a slim crescent inthe sky.
You wonder how long you've been in the cave.You are not hungry. You don't feel you have beensleeping. You wonder whether to tn; to walk backhome by moonlight or whether to wait for dawn,rather than risk losing your footing on the steep and rocky trail.

As you start walking back toward the ranch, younotice the trail seems very different than you re-member it, though of course moonlight can playtricks on your eyes. But you suddenly realize youare not walking on the trail at all, but on whatseems to be a dried-up river bed. You hurry backto the cave entrance. You look around you andrealize the whole landscape has changed. Whileyou were in the cave, torrents of water havewashed out the trail; yet there is not so much asapuddle left. You shiver. It is cold, much colder thanit should be at this time of year. You take a jacketout of your backpack and put it on, but you are still freezing.
At least the world about you seems brighter. It'sgetting light in the east. The sun will soon be up.You look at your watch. It has run down, thoughyou wound it only a few hours ago. Nothing seemsto make sense anymore.
You know you should get back to the ranchasquickly as pxjssible; yet somehow you feel the onlyway to change things back to the way they wereisto re-enter the cave.

You step into a niche in the rocks to escape themerciless blast of wind and lean back against therock wall. Suddenly it crumbles under yourweight, causing you to fall backward downamuddy slope and into a pond.
The sun shines brightly down on you as you pickyourself up, dripping wet, and wade to the grassyshore. You look back at the rock, rising out of thepond, but you can't see where you fell through.While you are collecting your senses, a horsecomes prancing up, its rider dressed in tinarmor—a knight out of the history booksenough to make you laugh. The horseman lifts offhis helmet and laughs himself.
"What a place for a bath!" he calls out. "Well,it was worth it—you're cleaner than a pig!" Heal-most falls off his horse, he is laughing so hard. "Butclimb on and I'll take you back to the castle," hesays. "We'll see if we can't make a human out of you yet."

As it gets lighter, you realize you can't be ontheright track. The canyon seems shallower thanitwas. The river bed is strewn with boulders thatwere never there before. The cold wind chills youto the bone; yet it's the middle of summer. Asyouclimb to higher ground to get a better view, younotice patches of snow. From the top of a ridgeyou survey a barren plain, frozen lakes, and, in thedistance, a massive range of snow-covered mountains. You begin to realize you are not merelylost—you are lost in time, and you have somehowbeen transported to an Ice Age that occurred manythousands of years ago.
You walk toward one of the cliffs that bordersthe canyon, seeking shelter from the wind, andnotice an entrance to another cave. Youaretempted to go inside, but you feel you should keepmoving in hopes of somehow reaching familiarcountry.

"Off to the tower," the King shouts. Two knightsleap forward, drag you out of the chamber, and,with spears at your back, force you to climb fortyeight stone steps to the tower prison—a tiny cylindrical room with one small window looking outover the moat and pasture land beyond. The onlyfumiture is a bed of straw. You realize you are back in the early days offeudal Europe, where the only laws are the King'swhims. You have no idea how long he intends tokeep you in the tower. There is one possibility ofescape. The water in the moat, about twenty-fivefeet almost directly below your window, is quitedeep. If you jump out far enough, you should landin the deep water and not be hurt.

You jump far out and fall faster and faster. Youenter the water feet first and hit bottom, but the softmud receives you gently. In a few seconds youreach the surface. You swim to the outer banksofthe moat, shaken but unharmed. You scramble upthe bank and run for the cover of the forest. You walk along the edge of the forest until wellout of sight of the castle, then head across the opencountryside. You stop a peasant to ask him whereyou might stay for the night.
"Walk up that hill and you'll see before you thewaters of Loch Ness," he says. "You'll find a placethere."
You follow his directions and, seeing some little houses near the lake, proceed toward them. Darkness is setting in, and you are glad when you meeta fisherman who says he will give you shelter forthe night. He and his wife are kindly people; theyinvite you to stay and earn your keep by helping them fish.

You decide to wait, but soon regret it. A guardvisits you twice a day and brings you only blackbread and water. In a few days you feel almost tooweak to escape even if you have the chance.
But just as you are beginning to despair of everregaining your freedom, the guard walks in, smiling.
"The King has ordered you out of here," hesays. "We have a much more importantprisoner—a man who insulted the King's horse."He laughs in your face. You don't know whetherhe is telling the truth or not, but he holds the doorand waves you out. You walk down the long flight
of stone steps to the main courtyard, free again
at least for the moment. The drawbridge is downand there seems to be nothing in the way of yourleaving the castle. There is a splendid black horse tied up near you,probably owned by one of the knights. It occurs toyou that you could cover a lot of ground on thathorse before anyone realizes what happened.

In a moment you are across the bridge andgalloping over the countryside, feeling a good dealsmarter than the King and his knights. Whenyoupass some shepherds and wave, they wave back.You stop to rest at the cottage of a friendlygoatherd, who feeds you a good dinner. "Donotfear the King," he says. "He is a fool who sits anddrinks grog all day. His only concern is decidingwho to put in the tower. His own knights laughathim, and he is more likely to fall from his thronethan you from your horse. Be off now and ontoMerrie England, for great things await you there.God speed and good fortune!"
Your energies are renewed by good food anddrink, and your horse too is ready to ride. Youthank your host warmly and ride off to new adventures and a new life—almost a thousand yearsbefore you are born.

You gain entrance to the King and thank him for letting you out of the tower.
"Think nothing of it," the King replies. "We would do as much for any villain. We like yourspirit and, though your story makes as much senseas a dancing mule, it brought laughter to our eyes.
You have, without meaning it we are sure, performed a service for your King. We thank you.
"We'll see that you have a horse and somepieces of gold," the King continues. "Go andmake your fortune. We command you though
come once a year and tell us a story no less amusing than what we have heard from your lips."
"My lord," you say. "My liege," he replies.

You resolutely trudge along a rocky ridge. It hasbeen cleared of whirling snow by the fierce wind,which bites and blows against your body.
The world seems transformed, and much for theworse. You must find a house or a cabin—^people who can help you—or you will die. As you ponder your fate, you stumble andfall,plunging into a deep crevasse. You black out andlater awaken, still shivering, but in a warmer placeat least. By the dim amber light, you can see thatsomehow you have fallen back into one of thechambers in the Cave of Time. A passagewayleads to the right, another to the left. Does oneleadto the future and one to the past?

As you enter the cave, you see a flickering lightahead and you smell smoke. You make your wayalong a winding passageway and enter a largechamber. Fires rise out of earthen vessels. Several short, stocky people with straight blackhair and primitive faces are painting pictures on thewalls of the cave. They are dressed in animal skins.In a comer of the cave are beds of straw. You stand, slightly afraid, as the cave peopledrop their work and run over and stare at youindisbelief. The largest man is carrying a long vine.He steps forward as though he might seize you andtie you up.

You continue on, following a trail leading up a steep incline. You hear loud, trumpeting soundsfrom a nearby ravine—the sounds of a large animal. You climb over some rocks and find yourself
looking down on one of the largest land mammals that ever lived—the wooly mammoth. Huge as this creature is, its size is exaggerated even more by its thick coat of wool.

You are cold, desperate, and tired. From yourrock ledge, only a few feet over the mammoth, youcould drop down on its back, burrow into its warmwool, and ride where it takes you!

The tunnel to the left winds around like a spiral, passing several more tunnels. 
You turn down one of them, then climb steeply. In a few moments you climb through a hole and emerge in a desert. 
The weather is extremely hot—certainly over 100 degrees, but the sun is just about to set, so it shouldbe getting cooler.
In the distance is a range of mountains, which look extremely high, yet are bare of snow. 
You have no idea whether you are inthe past, the future, or the present. Then you see something that fascinates and disturbs you. 
The sand seems to be fused into yellowish glass as if heated in a furnace. 
As you examine the sand more closely, you feel the air getting even hotter.
Suddenly you realize the sun is not setting, but rising! The noon time temperature must be more than life can stand. 
As the sun rises higher, you feel a blistering wave of heat. The light is almost blinding. 
Could it be that you are witnessing the end of the world?

You turn and walk back out of the cave. It should be dawn by now, but, as you grope yourway toward the entrance, you can't see any lightcoming into the cave. You press against the walls,feeling for an opening. Your hands pass acrosssomething cold, wet, and hard. Ice! The entranceis sealed by it. Blocks of ice protrude into the cave.You step back, feeling confused and helpless.You wish it were just a dream. You retrace yoursteps a way, trying to think clearly.

The laughing knight helps you up on his horseand you sit uncomfortably as it canters over thecountryside. After traveling a mile or so, you cometo a great, stone castle. The horse trots across thedrawbridge and into the stable. "Jump," the knight calls to you, and you slideoff the rear of the horse. The knight escorts youinto the grand chamber of the castle. All about youare stewards, attendants, and knights. A few minutes later you find yourself bowing before the Kinghimself.
After hearing your story, the King looks gravelyat his advisors and knights and stewards. "Doesanyone believe this tale?" he asks. Everyone cries back, "No, Your Majesty," or"Certainly not. Your Majesty."

You follow the left passageway. It leads upwardto the surface. Before you, a grassy meadowslopes down to a clear, fast-flowing stream; beyond it are pine-covered foothills stretching in thedistance toward snow-covered peaks. You mightbe in Wyoming in your own time, but, whatevertime it is, the world you see appears to be a hospitable one. You notice a herd of buffalo grazing. Butnowhere can you see a house, or fence, or road,orany sign of human presence. It is possible youareliving hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.You gaze upward.

You make friendly gestures. The man holdingthe vine steps back and smiles. The people talktoyou in a friendly fashion, but you cannot understand what they are saying, nor can they understand you. You feel awkward, but happy to besafeand warm for the moment.
Several people have gone back to workingontheir paintings. You decide to try communicatingthrough drawing. You begin to draw a pictureofyourself eating. The cave people laugh, but oneofthem brings you a slice of half -cooked meat.It
doesn't taste very good, but you are so hungry youdon't mind.
Gradually you make friends and learn a few
words. Some of the people go hunting and comeback with game. Others make clothing from animal skins. You help with cleaning and cooking andeach day paint a picture on the walls. The others
are fascinated by your drawings of airplanes, ships,
and cars—things they see only as abstract designs,
for they have no way of knowing what function
they could serve. One day a group of other people visit. You havenever seen them before, but your friends welcomethem warmly, holding a great feast in their honor.
After everyone is through eating, the conversation
intensifies. You can tell that the cave people are
talking about a serious problem. Then, one byone, they drift off to sleep. You walk outside to see
if you can learn anything. The ground is coveredwith deep snow. A bitter cold wind blows the snowin whirling clouds.
Next morning, the people pack up their belongings and they urge you to do so also. Some migration is obviously intended—no doubt to a warmerclimate. You feel you should go with the cave
people, but you have a great longing to return to your own home, and your only hope of doing so is to find your way back to the Cave of Time.

You can see no future for yourself with theseprimitive people, so you run back toward the Cave of Time. Fortunately, they do not follow you, and you are able to find your way.
By the time you re-enter the cave, you are hungry and exhausted. The light is dimmer than before and you grope your way along, looking for a passageway. You stumble and fall head first down an embankment, bumping your head disagreeably. You look up and see daylight ahead. A minute later, you walk out of the cave into warm, moist air near a forest of leafy trees. A bird flies by. You don't know when it is, but it looks pleasant enough.

As you land, the mammoth shudders like ahorse shaking off flies. It begins lumbering alongup the valley, apparently unaware you are still clinging to its wooly back, keeping warm and enjoying the ride. The mammoth reaches high ground, nibbles at some bark, and then walks on. Perhaps it will carry
you near some cave men who will give you foodand shelter. Suddenly the mammoth stops and turns its head—listening for something. You look up andsee human figures approaching from two sides. They are carrying spears and clubs. The mammoth begins to run. You hold on tight. The huntersfollow—screaming and yelling. You can't seewhere the mammoth is heading, but you're afraid
the hunters may drive it off a cliff. Yet, if you jumpoff while it's running, you could be badly hurt.

Riding on a mammoth might be fun if you werenot cold and hungry and lost, but where wouldittake you? You continue walking, your spirits sinking. Just as you feel ready to sit down and cry, yousee an opening in the ground. You crawl in onyour hands and knees. It might provide somewarmth, and it might lead to the Cave of Time.You find yourself in a tunnel. There are othertunnels branching off. You feel sure now you areinthe Cave of Time.

You take the first tunnel and follow it on and onuntil you begin to wonder whether you are goingaround in circles. What can this mean? Perhapstime itself is slowing. You are nearing the point ofexhaustion, and begin to feel very cold. You see anopening up ahead and stars shining. You stepoutside on barren ground. It is bitter cold. Eventhough there is no wind, you know you will freezeif you stay more than a few minutes—maybe notthat long, for the air seems very thin, as if you wereon top of a very high mountain.

After following the passageway for a considerable distance, you enter a very large tunnel thatseems as likely as any to lead you back to your owntime. You continue along and soon notice that thefloor of the tunnel is becoming sandier. Perhapsyou are coming to a beach. Then the sand givesway under your feet; you slide through sand andrising dust. You cannot stop yourself—it is toosteep; then there is nothing under your feet, andamoment later you land in deep water. You swimtothe surface and catch your breath. You are in anunderwater grotto, which seems completelysealed off except for a portion of its roof thatisopen to the blue sky. You swim to a large, smoothrock sloping into the water. The sand is white, and the water transparent.The rocks are made of crystalline material of themost delicate shades of blue. For a momentyouare overwhelmed by the beauty of the scene before you, but you soon begin to wonder whetheryou can escape from it. There is no way of climbingout through the opening in the roof.

Dressed as warmly as possible in your crudeboots and coat of animal skins, you leave shortlyafter sunup with the others, a ragged band of thirtymen, women, and children. Luckily there are nobabies; they could never survive the migration.The sun shows briefly through the clouds, the windabates, and you make good progress on yoursouthward journey.
After only a few days of travel, everyoneisnearing exhaustion. The hunters have not beenable to find enough game. There is no way to lighta fire at night and the only way to keep fromfreezing is to sleep huddled together.
After a week though, you notice the sun shinesmore warmly at midday and the snow is not quiteso deep. It begins to look as though you will survive, though you must give up hope of ever return-ing to your own time.

You pack up your few belongings. The one youprize most is a knife carved from the tusk of awooly mammoth. 
You wave goodbye to yourfriends and trudge through the snow, trying toretrace your steps back to the Cave of Time.
Though the wind is colder than ever, the bright sunstirs your hopes.
You have become much more rugged from liv-ing with the cave people, and your crude animal skin clothes keep you surprisingly warm. 
You find your way down into the canyon and in a few hours reach the entrance to the cave, now almost covered with blowing snow. 
You are exhausted from the long trek, and youreyes are watering from the cold wind. 
You hardlynotice the large, gray shape only a few yards fromthe entrance to the cave until you hear the deep,guttural growl of a wolf. 
Now you stare directly intoits cold, cruel eyes. You feel that at your slightestmovement it will spring at you. 
You must thinkwhat to do before you move. You probably couldoutrun the wolf to the cave. 
It might hesitate beforefollowing you—and give you enough time toescape—or you could try to knife the wolf in thethroat as it leaps at you.

Slowly you unsheath your knife and then run forthe entrance. The wolf is after you like a shot. It leaps and tears your bearskin coat. 
While the wolfis regaining its balance, you run into the cave andtoward the left tunnel. 
The wolf runs after you.You look over your shoulder and lose your footing. Instead of falling on the ground, you feel yourself sliding down a long, steep chute. 
Farabove, the wolf howls with frustration. You land ina heap at the bottom of a pit—^shaken but un-harmed. 
There is a dark passageway to the left. You toss in a stone and, after what seems like a longtime, you hear a splash far below. 
Fortunately,there is another passageway to the right, which is dimly lit by phosphorescent light.

Holding your knife with its long ivory bladepointing upward, you advance very slowly, step bystep, toward the wolf, 
which stands growling softly,apparently confused by your boldness. Then it springs. You lunge with your knife, twist-ing your 
body to avoid its awesome fangs. Your knife cuts through nothing but air, but the wolfsucceeds only in tearing off your bearskin coat.
It stops for an instant to sniff at the coat, and you turnand plunge your knife into its neck.
The wolf twists,looks at you with hate in its eyes, and falls limp, itsspinal cord severed. Now you are a true Stone Age hunter. 
Youskinthe wolf and walk into the cave. You follow the right-hand tunnel, thinking youmay find your way back to your own time, 
but suddenly you feel yourself falling—faster and faster into what seems a bottomless pit.

Suddenly you hear voices shouting. You hide ina thicket. An animal crashes through the brush. In a moment some men rush by in pursuit, 
carryingspears and slings. You imagine that you must beinan era long before the advent of civilization. You follow an animal trail; 
it soon leads to a clearing, and you lie down in the grass to rest. Looking upinthe sky, you see a long, thin, white streak. 
You rub your eyes and look again. It seems to be a vapor trail from a jet plane! You may be living in thepresent time after all. 
After several days of wandering through thejungle, you reach a settlement on the banks ofalarge river. 
There is an airfield nearby, and within a few weeks you are able to obtain a ride back to civilization and return to your family—just 
a monthafter you first entered the Cave of Time. Youarehappy to be back home, but shocked at how mucholder everyone looks. 
And they express thegreatest surprise that after eleven years you haven't changed a bit!

You work your way back to the mammoth'srump and slide down, landing hard on the icyground, where you lie aching and bruised, 
whilethe mammoth lumbers on. Suddenly it disappears, driven off the cliff. The hunters are shoutingand cheering. 
Some of them come up to you.They are short and muscular, their jaws jut out,and they have bright squinting eyes. 
Their blackhair hangs down to their shoulders. They aredressed in animal skins. You look up helplessly, wondering what they will do to you,
but in an instant you can see theywill not hurt you. They help you up and carry youback to their cave and feed you steaming broth. 
It tastes awful, but makes you feel much better. Yousoon learn that the cave people will accept youasone of them, 
because you have without realizingit—performed the sacred rite of their culture byriding bravely on the back of a mammoth.
Life is harsh and simple with the cave people, and sometimes you long for your family, your friends, and your own time again; 
yet your new life is as exciting and happy as you could wish for.

You hold tightly to tufts of wool, hoping themammoth will slow down enough so you cansafely slide off. 
But suddenly it pitches forward,making a terrible bellowing. In an instant yourealize you are falling through space.
You cry outhelplessly as you lose your grip, falling faster andfaster. Thousands of years later when Dr. CarletonFrisbee,

You enter the next tunnel you come to. It be-comes smaller and smaller until you must crawl.You continue this way for almost an hour.
Finally,your faith is justified, for you smell a fresh breezeblowing across a field of new-mown hay.
A moment later you are blinking your eyes in thebright sunlight, looking at a beautiful meadownestled between gentle hills. 
A dozen or more cowsare grazing near a meandering stream. In the dis-tance is a dirt road. 
A farmer is sitting on a cart filledwith hay. A dapple-gray horse is pulling the carttoward a big red bam in the distance. 
From the other direction you hear the mournful hooting ofatrain whistle. You turn around and see that you are only a fewhundred feet 
from the railroad tracks. A train ischugging around the bend, puffs of black smokerising from its coal-fired steam engine. 
You are outof the Ice Age, all right, but not exactly in your own time.

The train slows down as it approaches you, andyou smile as you see the reason why a cow is standing on the tracks just ahead, 
looking as if it would not move for anything. The train pulls to astop, and a man jumps down from the cab, waving a coal shovel at 
the cow, which waits almost untilthe man is upon her before strolling back into thepasture. At that moment you realize you couldeasily

Through computer instruction you are abletolearn the language, which you find is similartoEnglish, so you are soon able to communicatewithyour hosts. They are not at all surprised to hear that youarrived through the Cave of Time.
"You are not the first," the head of the household tells you, "but we have visitors from othertimes only once in a great while.

Your hosts give you a fine bedroom with largewindows overlooking the park on one side. 
Onanother wall is a beautiful painting of the California seacoast. When you push a button, the painting folds up to the ceiling,

You take a deep breath, dive down, and swimthrough the tunnel. There is light ahead. In a moment you surface in a beautiful lagoon. 
Thatched cottages are nestled among the palm trees that rim the white sand beach. A warm, soft breeze bringsthe scent of jasmine 
and the sound of strangemelodies from sonorous drums. Looking outtothe inlet from the sea, you can see a fleet of outrigger

You walk toward the village. Several handsome, brown-skinned people see you. Someofthem run away, but others walk toward you withhands

When you reach the surface, it is completelydark. A chill wind is blowing. You sit resolutelywaiting for dawn so that you can

Nearby,splinters oi wood are floating in the water. 'That was Sutherland's boat," Angus cries out."It's been a hundred

The monster swims away and soon is lost fromview in the mists. "How could the monster be gone for a hundredyears 
and then return?" you ask Angus.
"Somewhere near Beatty's Point," he replies,"there is an underwater cave where the monsterstays as long as it 
pleases—because it is a Cave of Time."
If only you could find your way back to the Caveof Time! But chances seem slim, and the risksseem great.

Could you change history and save hundredsoflives by warning the captain that the "unsinkable"Titanic is destined for the bottom of the Atlantic?You see some stairs leading to a higher deck, andyou run up them.
A steward is standing near the top. "You can'tcome up here," he cries. But you dart past him andrun toward the forward part of the ship. You dashup another set of stairs, where you find yourself atthe starboard wing of the bridge. The graybearded captain is standing only a few feet away,looking out to sea through his binoculars at a shipon the horizon.
' 'Captain,
' ' you call out. ' 'You may not realize it, but this ship will sink in only two or three hours."He turns and looks at you gravely. "I know,"hesays softly. "But we are going to fire distress rockets. That ship out there—the Califomian—^shouldrespond to help us."
"They will not respond. Captain," you tell him."They can't believe the Titanic could be in trouble,even though they see your rockets. Your onlyhope is to put your strongest men in a lifeboat andhave them row toward the Califomian at topspeed—firing rockets as they approach."
"Great heavens, you have bold ideas," the captain replies, "but I need every man I have to lowerour lifeboats and keep order among the passengers. I can't believe the Califomian will not comewhen they see our rockets.

You reach the shore and walk along thelakeside, deeper and deeper into the cavern,which is lit by a mysterious blue light. Then, ahead,you see what you had hoped to find—a tunnel thatsurely must lead to the Cave of Time. Nearbyinthe sand are three eggs as large as footballs. Youpick one up and carry it into the tunnel.

bottpm of the crevasse and reach an opening onthe other side of the ridge, where you half expectto see the rolling countryside, the stream and the
space ship that were there before.
Instead, the crevasse leads to the ocean! Like abad dream, where the scene suddenly changesinto something entirely different, you find that the
hills have become waves, which surround you so
that the rock you are standing on is only a reef
protruding a few yards above the wind-swept seas. And there seems to be no escape, because, for all you can tell, you are standing on the only land in the world.

You walk back through the cavern, wonderingifthe entrance will still be blocked by ice. This time,though, you are greeted b.y a warm breeze. Sunlight is shining on the ground near the entrance,and you walk outside.
Squinting your eyes in the bright light, youseeaworld totally different from the one you know.Youare on a hillside. For miles and miles you canseegrassy plains speckled with lakes. Nearby is a forestof towering ferns, swaying in the wind. The worldbefore you seems strangely quiet, except for thefaint rumbling of distant thunder. Suddenly,thethunder seems much closer—and louder. Thethundering sound is moving through the ferns.You run up the hill looking for a place to hide.Ahuge shadow passes on the ground. Aboveyou,soaring through the air, is a creature larger thanany bird you have seen.
Now it is clear what has been happening. Thecave is a crack in the universe—a place outside
space-time. Once inside its tunnels you could find
yourself at any place, at any time. If you enter
again you might be sent to a place from which youcould never escape. Yet that is your only hope of
returning to your own place and time.

Inside the cave again, you feel depressedandconfused. Your eyes do not seem to be gettingused to the dim light. 
You cannot find anypassageways leading to other times. You feel increasingly drowsy. 
Soon you fall asleep on the cold clayfloor of the cave. Sometime later you awaken. The cave is pitchdark, 
but the bright light at the opening tells youthe sun is shining brightly outside. You walkoutinto the daylight and, 
to your surprise and delight,you see Snake Canyon, the trail, the grove of pinetrees nearby—everything just as it was 
when you entered the cave. Even the sun is in the sameplace, just about to pass behind the rim of the canyon. 
Somehow you have returned to yourowntime—or more precisely, the time it was before you fell asleep in the cave. 
You rub your eyes and start down the path backto the Red Creek Ranch with a story to tell thatnoone will believe,
but that you will never forget.

Reasoning that you can always find your wayback into the cave when you want to, you decide
to explore the world in which you have foundyourself.
You make your way along a rock ledge over- looking the plains and lakes, taking care to keepyour bearings so you can find your way back to the
cave. By now you are getting very hungry. You knowthat you are in the age of reptiles—at least 100million years ago—and that mammals may not yet
have appeared on earth. There will be no rabbits or deer to hunt, though the lakes may contain fish. You wonder how dinosaur eggs taste. You follow a wide path through the fern trees. When you round the first bend, you find yourself
face to face with the horrible Triceratops, a great
gray monster almost hidden behind its shields andhoms. It looks at you curiously with dull browneyes. You turn, run, and crash into a tree trunk
one that wasn't there before!
The bark feels like leather. You look up to see how high it is—into the jaws of Tyrannosaurus Rex.

You continue a long distance until you cometoithe next tunnel. From there it is only a shortdis-^tance until you reach the surface. An amazingsightmeets your eyes.
As far as you can see, the land looks likeabeautiful park, with soft, feathery grass and towering trees. Here and there are clusters of multi-Jcolored, dome-shaped buildings, connectedby1ramps, terraces and walkways. Some peopledressed in simple khaki pants and shirts andtansneakers walk up to you. They do not understandyour language, nor you theirs. They look muchlike the people of your time except that theyareunusually trim, muscular, and healthy looking,and they are a good deal smaller than yourownIpeople.
They take you inside a dome-shaped buildingand show you electronic equipment that lookslikeja computer. You notice a typewriter, so you sit atitand type a message.
The computer prints out a reply. It apparentlyhas access to memory banks containing your language. You soon discover you are living in the year 3742.

You dive down into the tunnel, hoping you canmake it back to an earlier time. Gratefully, you feel cool, damp air coming up from the cave. You are curious to try the next tunnel you come to, thinking
that it may show the state of the world just before it began to burn up from the intensifying heat of the
dying sun, or that it might show what happenedafterward! But you suspect that a tunnel further onmight be more likely to lead you back to your owntime.

You climb up the steps between the last car andthe caboose just as the train begins to start upagain. When you open the door to the car, youaresurprised to see soldiers in blue uniforms holdingold-fashioned rifles. They advance upon you. Oneof them strides past you to see if anyoneelsefollowed you.
"How did you know this was the President'scar?" the first soldier asks you.
"What President?" you reply.
Then, to your amazement, you get the answerto your question, for the very tall bearded manwalking down the aisle could be no one else butAbraham Lincoln.
"That's all right," the President tells the soldiers,"I could use some company right now. Youmaystay until we reach Gettysburg," he says to you."But maybe you should get off at Parkersville.Iknow of some good people there who will helpyou out."

"I'd like to stay on till Gettysburg," you say."Well, that's fine," the President replies. "Whydon't you sit across from me? I have to write outalittle talk I'm giving there, and, while I'm doingthat, you think about what you're going to makeofyour life, because you can't spend all yourtimeriding on trains, after all." You nod in agreement and sit quietly watchingthe President scribbling some lines on anenvelope. After awhile he looks up from his writingand you look each other in the eyes.
"You have a great future," he says abruptly."How can you tell," you ask. "By looking at your face."
"Just by that?"
"Just so."
As you are talking, you notice two elaboratelydressed men approaching from the end of thecar.They whisper a few words to the President.Heexcuses himself, shakes hands with you, andtellsone of his soldiers to see that you are providedforin Gettysburg.

97When you arrive at Gettysburg, one of the sol-diers takes you to a family who welcomes youwarmly and agrees to put you up for awhile, if youwill help them out with their farm.
You find it amazing to be living in a time with nocars, radios, television, record players, or eventelephones. It's peaceful—at least when there is not a war going on—but you feel homesick. Youfeel the great future the President predicted for youlies in your own time, and you resolve to find yourway back to the Cave of Time.

If you take the train, it may ruin your chancetoreturn to the Cave of Time. It seems best to stayclose to the tunnel. At any rate, you decide youwillbe able to think better after getting somethingtoeat, so you walk over to the farmhouse.
The farmer's wife gives you a bowl of soup, butshe won't believe the story you make up to explainyour presence there. You soon get the idea youare not welcome, so you trudge on into town,where the innkeeper lets you have a room for thenight.
The next morning you get a ride on a coachtoPhiladelphia. A Quaker family takes you in andhelps you get work as a carpenter's apprentice.You don't like the job, and soon you leave

Philadelphia to go to New York, where you areable to find a job working for a newspaper. Eventually you travel all over the world. You live a longand wonderful life, dying just a few years beforeyou are bom.

It's less than a mile to Parkersville, and the President shakes your hand and wishes you luck. Oneof the soldiers arranges with the station agent for acarriage to take you to a farm owned by an oldfriend of his. You soon become a member of the family. Theyare good people and make you feel very muchathome. You are surprised to learn, however, thatthey plan to sell their farm and move to Califomia.The new life in the West they describe is so appealing that you decide to go with them.
You never regret it, except, sometimes, youwish you could see your own time again.

With considerable trepidation you slide downthe tunnel. You mean to turn off at one of the sidepassageways that might take you back to your owntime, but you are too exhausted to search for theentrance. You half slide, half climb downthetunnel—further back into time—then you loseyour balance. You fall a great distance, landindeep water, and sink a long ways.
You are barely able to surface and, whenyoudo, you find that the air is filled with dense fog. Thewater is warm, but the fog is so thick you canhardly breathe. The air smells slightly of sulphur.Gasping for breath, you realize you must be several billion years in the past and that oxygenhasnot yet been released into the atmosphere.

You sit down and rest your chin in your hands,unable to believe the fate that has befallen you. Tolive forever in a timeless world seems worse thandeath.
"Well, to tell the truth, there is a way to get backto your own time," the woman finally says, "but, if you follow it, you will not be able to live forever."
"I don't care," you say. "Show me the way.""Very well," she says, shaking her head in disbelief. "Dive under the rock ledge beneath me andswim through the tunnel you will find there. Youwill come up in your own time. Don't worry, it's only a few yards. You can make it." You take a last look around, wave good-byeand dive. A few seconds later you surface in apond just inside the entrance of the Cave of Time.You swim to shore and run out through the caveentrance into the open air, almost crashing intoyour Uncle Howard, who has come looking foryou.
"You're late for dinner," he says. "We wondered what happened to you. You ought to keepbetter track of the time."

The next day you call the Department of Zoology at a nearby university, where you are referredto Dr. Henry Kam, a specialist in large reptiles. Dr.Kam is skeptical about the egg but agrees to driveto Red Creek Ranch immediately to see it. By the time he arrives, you are feeling verynervous. Suppose the egg is just made of plastic?Your concern is heightened by his stern appearance. He shakes hands brusquely with you andyour uncle and immediately asks to see the egg.When you hand it to him, he says nothing whilehe stares intently at it, holds it up to the light, tapsitand scratches it with a pen knife. Then he holdsitto his ear. Finally he smiles at you and gently puts the eggdown. "It's quite possible this is the egg ofaPlesiosaurus, an aquatic dinosaur of the late Jurassic period. It is highly unlikely it will ever hatch.Even so, I would want to keep it in an incubatoratthe University for at least a year before breakingitopen. I'll let you know, of course, if anything develops."

When you tell him you come from theTwentiethCentury through the Cave of Time, Nick smiles.Then you tell him a little about life in your owntime—about cars and planes, telephones and tele-vision. He listens intently, with a big grin onhisface, as if you are telling th funniest story ever told."I'm so glad to meet you," Nick says. "I'vealways wanted to know about life in the TwentiethCentury." He tries to look serious, but beginstolaugh, thinking it's all a joke.
"Seriously," you say, (since you know he willnever believe you) "I have no home. Do you knowof a place where I can stay?"

"I'm sure you can stay at our house," he sayswarmly. "We have such a big family, one morewon't matter, but you must be willing to work in the shop with the rest of us."
Since you feel you hardly have any otherchoice, you accept his offer and feel grateful whenhis parents give you a good dinner and a comfortable bed. Nick tells you, with much seriousness,
that you are living in the year 1718 in Boston, the
principal town in the British colony of Massachusetts.
You soon become one of the family. They are good people and treat you well. But each day youhave to work long hours boiling soap and pouringit into molds, waiting on customers and doingerrands for Nick's father, whom you have come to know as Uncle Ted.
Your neighbor, Mr. Nelson, is a printer. He re- cently returned from England with a printing press
and letter type he bought there. The business in- terests you, and you consider working as his apprentice, but to do so you would have to sign
papers indenturing yourself to work faithfully for him for six full years.

You do your best to make up a story about howyou ran away from home, but Nick sees that youare not telling him the truth. While you're talking,he packs up his fishing gear, says goodbye, andwalks off. Once he is out of sight, you start down the roadand, after a mile or so, reach a settled area. Whileyou are standing near a church, wondering whattodo next, a constable approaches and asks whereyou're from. This time you try to explain whatrealli; happened. After listening awhile, he arrestsyou for disorderly conduct and locks you up in thelocal jail. Later in the day, a big, stupid-looking guardcomes to bring you a ration of soup and bread.Heis fascinated by your strange clothes and bytherumors he has heard about you. After openingthedoor to your cell, he hands you your food andstands back and looks at you curiously.
'They say you're in league with the devil," hesays. "Is it so?"

Although you feel you would probably enjoythe printing business more than a career as a soapmaker, you wish to remain free to take advantageof some other opportunity.
The work with Uncle Ted is tedious. You feel you could not bear life devoted to making candlesand soap. You spend most of your spare timereading what books you can lay hold of, but youare anxious to travel and see the world.
Not long afterwards, you sign up on the brigantine, Nina, as a deck hand. The ship is owned by arich merchant, and it is bound for Barbados in the
West Indies with a load of lumber and then on to England.
You find life at sea much harder than you expected, especially when you are required to climbthe rigging in a howling gale, but eventually youbecome captain of your own ship. In every placeyou visit you ask the people you meet whetherthey have ever heard of the Cave of Time.

You go to work in Mr. Nelson's shop and soonbecome proficient in the art of printing. But after awhile, you become increasingly unhappy. Mr.
Nelson refuses to raise your wages or give you achance to own part of the business. There are nojobs available for you in Boston, so you decide to move to Philadelphia, where you have heard there
is a greater demand for printing.
Happily, Mr. Nelson agrees to release you fromyour indenture, and by selling almost all your possessions, you are able to raise enough money to engage passage on a coastal schooner. After a longand stormy voyage down the coast, your ship
docks early on a Sunday morning at the MarketStreet wharf in Philadelphia.
You are tired and hungry and you use some of
your last money to buy a loaf of bread. Out of
curiosity, you follow some well-dressed peopleinto the Quaker meeting house. The people seat themselves, but, following custom, no one speaks.
It is so peaceful you fall sound asleep. When youawaken, the Quakers welcome you. One family
gives you lodging and, fortunately, you are able to get a job with one of the two printers in the town.
You work hard to improve your skills asaprinter. Within a few years, with the help of somefriends, you are able to raise enough moneytogointo business on your own. Your printing business thrives, and after awhileyou start your own newspaper. It begins to lookasif the Eighteenth Century is a pretty good time for you to be alive.

lThe guard is too startled, and maybe even tooafraid, to stop you as you dart past him and out ofthe jail house. You run down the street as fast asyou can. As you stop to catch your breath, a thin,
bearded man driving a coach pulls up next to you."You seem to be in some trouble," he calls out."Can I be of help?"
Too tired to make up any story, you begin to tell him everything that has happened to you. Heis very excited by your story and invites you to anearby tavern, where you have your first goodmeal since you left Red Creek ranch. Your hosthardly eats anything. He looks pale and seems tohave a bad cough.
When you finish recounting your tale, he says,"It is strange that we have met. I have tuberculosis,and no doctor in Boston can help me. Myonlyhope is to reach a future time."
"I think it's my only hope too," you say.
"If we help each other, I think we can find ourway back to your time—my new time," he replies.The two of you shake hands on it and set outonyour quest the next day at sunrise.
